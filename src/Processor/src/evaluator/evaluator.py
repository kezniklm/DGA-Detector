 * @file evaluator.py
 * @brief Evaluates data using a pre-trained machine learning model.

 * This file contains the implementation of the Evaluator class, which is used to predict outcomes based on input data using a pre-loaded machine learning model. The class is designed to handle evaluation in a straightforward manner by loading the model once and using it to predict data as required.

 * The main functionalities of this file include:
 * - Loading a machine learning model from a specified file path using joblib.
 * - Predicting outcomes for input data provided as a pandas DataFrame.
 * - Returning the predictions in a pandas DataFrame format, facilitating further processing or analysis.
